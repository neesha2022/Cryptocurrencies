## Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose:

Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the bank's new investment. We will use unsupervised learning for the following analysis: 

-Preprocessing the Data for PCA

-Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

-Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

-Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Results:
### Finding the Best Value for k Using the Elbow Curve
